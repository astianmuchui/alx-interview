Must Know
For this project, you will need a solid understanding of several key concepts in order to develop a solution that can efficiently determine if all boxes can be opened. Hereâ€™s a list of concepts and resources that will be instrumental in tackling this project:

Concepts Needed:
Lists and List Manipulation:

Understanding how to work with lists, including accessing elements, iterating over lists, and modifying lists dynamically.
Python Lists (Python Official Documentation)
Graph Theory Basics:

Although not explicitly required, knowledge of graph theory (especially concepts related to traversal algorithms like Depth-First Search or Breadth-First Search) can be very helpful in solving this problem, as the boxes and keys can be thought of as nodes and edges in a graph.
Graph Theory (Khan Academy)
Algorithmic Complexity:

Understanding the time and space complexity of your solution is important, as it can help in writing more efficient algorithms.
Big O Notation (GeeksforGeeks)
Recursion:

Some solutions might require a recursive approach to traverse through the boxes and keys.
Recursion in Python (Real Python)
Queue and Stack:

Knowing how to use queues and stacks is crucial if implementing a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to traverse through the keys and boxes.

Set Operations:

Understanding how to use sets for keeping track of visited boxes and available keys can optimize the search process.
